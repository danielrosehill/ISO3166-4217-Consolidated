# Changelog 

This changelog reflects modifications made to the source ISO datasheets in order to make this dataset a useful lookup reference for most mainstream analytical contexts. 

The objective of this dataset is to consolidate ISO-3166 (countries) and ISO-4127 (currencies) to provide a quick reference single dataset to answer questions like:

- What's the ISO code for Australia and what's the currency code for the Australian Dollar?

For that reason, various currencies provided by ISO-4217 but not the national currency were removed (see the `edited` vs `original` split in source). 

Specifically these were the special settlement units (Chile's CLF, IMF's XDR) given that these are not legal tender in specific countries.
